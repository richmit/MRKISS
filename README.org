*use* and *experiment with* explicit Runge-Kutta methods.

This library powers the [[https://richmit.github.io/StrangeAttractorZoo/][Strange Attractor Zoo]].

   - TLDR: I've completed most of the functionality I was looking for,
     and I don't foresee any API changes when I add the few items left
     on my list.  Test coverage solid for the low level bits, but I
     plan on improving coverage for the high level API. I also have a
     few examples I would like to add.
